From **industrial revolution** that bring us democracy to **automation revolution** that moves more an more people into service industry from industrial.

### Data is the new oil
Many of the new Biggest world companies are characterized by a very simple feature. They control information flows. Google, Facebook, Amazon - they earn money with ads. And **their ads are so poweverfull** because they know **when and what to show** for a user that he eventually buys proposed service or goods.
